## Mission

Our mission is to create a "living memory" database that preserves and recalls cherished memories for individuals with degenerative cognitive conditions, such as Alzheimer's and dementia. By integrating AI and advanced vector-mapping technology, we offer a meaningful way to record, transcribe, and store memories, making them easily accessible through conversational prompts. Our goal is to enable users to relive their past experiences and create moments of joy, familiarity, and comfort. We aim to foster a deeper sense of connection and provide a dignified, supportive tool that nurtures memory and personal identity.

## About

**Yaad** is an innovative web application designed to preserve and revisit the cherished memories of individuals, particularly those with degenerative cognitive conditions like Alzheimer's and dementia. Our app allows users to record, transcribe, and store their memories securely while using AI to retrieve specific experiences based on prompts. With this unique blend of technology and empathy, Yaad aims to foster moments of connection, comfort, and joy through personalized memory recall.

## Technologies We Use

### Next.js
Our app is built using **Next.js**, a powerful React-based framework that enhances performance and enables seamless server-side rendering. This ensures a smooth user experience, with rapid page loading and efficient memory recall, no matter where users are located.

### Clerk for Authentication
We use **Clerk** to manage user authentication securely. It provides a user-friendly login and sign-up process, supporting features like passwordless login and multi-factor authentication, ensuring that user data and memories are kept safe and accessible only to authorized individuals.

### Pinecone for Database and Vector Embeddings
At the core of our memory retrieval system is **Pinecone**, a high-performance vector database solution. Pinecone allows us to store vector embeddings of recorded memories, enabling our AI to quickly and accurately retrieve related memories based on specific prompts. This advanced search capability makes it easier to find and relive memories that may have faded over time.

### Tailwind CSS for User Interface
We’ve designed the Living Memory interface with **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind enables rapid, responsive UI development, ensuring that our app is visually appealing, accessible, and easy to navigate for users of all ages and tech familiarity levels.
